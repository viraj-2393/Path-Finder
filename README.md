# Path-Finder
The path finder is written in javascript it uses BellmanFord algorithm to find shortest path from the source to the destination.
It also have some barriers to overcome and find the shortest path, if the destination is surrounded by barriers and no route exists, it doesn't travel to the destination.
# Important Points
1. To travel to any other node in any direction it takes 1 unit of length.
2. Every node is connected with two other nodes in right and down order.
3. Reverse path traversal can be achieved.
